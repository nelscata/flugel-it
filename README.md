# test-jenkins
Initial test requested by Pablo Planas:

I would like a Jenkins pipeline that builds the Sprint PetClinic Sample Application (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic). Using the official Jenkins Docker Image, extend it to build that application (build only). Use groovy scripting and create the Jenkinsfile to setup Jenkins in a local workstation automatically. I expect to checkout the code, run docker build and docker run, to login into the Jenkins UI to trigger the build job.
